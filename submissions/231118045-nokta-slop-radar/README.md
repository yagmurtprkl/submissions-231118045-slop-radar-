# Nokta Slop Radar - Week 3 Submission

**Student No:** `231118045`  
**Submission Folder:** `submissions/231118045-nokta-slop-radar/`  
**Project Theme:** Voice-first anti-slop audit, avatar feedback, forge repair loop, expert bridge  
**Chosen Track:** `PERSONAS + BRIDGE`

## Project Summary

Nokta Slop Radar is a mobile audit assistant for product reports and pitch drafts. The user speaks a report, watches the live voice visualizer react, receives avatar-delivered feedback, and can push repeated failures into a forge loop. When the loop gets stuck, the app exposes an expert bridge for human escalation.

Core flow:

1. Speak or paste a report draft.
2. Watch the voice visualizer and avatar react in real time.
3. Run an audit and receive a slop score plus repair actions.
4. Simulate or run forge cycles.
5. Trigger expert escalation on repeated broken cycles.
